# Folksy
a PHP web framework focusing on simplicity and being easily modifiable<br>
<h1>Goals</h1>
This is a web framework I'm working on personally, that is going to be focused on 3 main things<br>
<ul>
  <li>Readability</li>
  <li>Modifiabilty</li>
  <li>Simplicity</li>
</ul>  
Over engineering your code is a bad plague. I want this code to be easy to manage for beginners yet still be secure and fast enough to use in production.

<h1>Guidelines</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure to read our <a href="https://github.com/InsDel2113/Folksy/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of conduct</a> and <a href="https://github.com/InsDel2113/Folksy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">Contribution guidelines</a></li>
</ul>  
<h1><i>Is it ready?</i></h1>
Currently, I would argue that the code <em>is not ready</em> for production usage. It's still buggy and needs work, I will be actively updating it.
<h1><i>Documentation?</i></h1>
I do plan to work on documentation(or automatic generation of it, per se) for this framework
<h1>Pull requests</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure to read our <a href="https://github.com/InsDel2113/Folksy/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of conduct</a> and <a href="https://github.com/InsDel2113/Folksy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">Contribution guidelines</a></li>
  <li>I will review and accept any valid pull requests that come in.</li>
</ul>
