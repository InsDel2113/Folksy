a PHP web framework focusing on simplicity and being easily modifiable
<hr>
This is a web framework I'm working on personally, that is going to be focused on 3 main things
1. Readability
2. Modifiabilty
3. Simplicity
<hr>
Over engineering your code is a bad plague. I want this code to be easy to manage for beginners yet still be secure and fast enough to use in production.
